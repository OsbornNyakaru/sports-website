In and around the flurry of activity, we got looks — some just glimpses, some longer — at members of the rookie class of 2022 (drafted or not) who will offer the league a youthful boost going forward.

                    Here’s how those facing the loftiest expectations, the lottery picks, fared in Vegas, with a few honorable mentions for those newbies outside that select 14:</p>

                    star Neymar has no interest in leaving this summer, according to Goal.


The 30-year-old still has three years left in his current deal with the French giants and remains focused on his involvement with Brazil's national team at the 2022 World Cup in November.

PSG were reportedly willing to let him go if they were to receive a suitable offer this summer.

Neymar intends to be in good shape ahead of the World Cup in Qatar and has returned PSG to begin preparations for the new season.

PSG's new coach Christophe Galtierhe also wants the ex-Barcelona striker to stay and has plans to bring the best out of him.
