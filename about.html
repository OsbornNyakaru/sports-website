Section <br> applies to visitors using a Sky ID on any Sky platforms, such as Sky.com or any Sky hardware (such as but not limited to Sky Glass) in addition to the terms and conditions which precede and follow this section and/or any other terms and conditions that may apply to that platform. Attention is drawn in particular in these terms and conditions, to paragraph 2 (acceptable use), paragraph 5 (liability for information provided on the Sky site) above and this paragraph <br>.

<br>.1 Registration etc. In order to participate in parts of Sky.com, registration is required. You must be a Sky digital subscriber in order to register as the primary user but can nominate guest users provided they are part of the same household and they consent. To register as the primary user, you are required to provide us with accurate and complete details including your viewing card number. You must also choose a user name and password. Any guest user you nominate must also provide a user name and password which must be different to that of the primary user.

<br>.2 User name and password. When choosing a user name, a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 40 alphanumerical characters must be used. URLs, Domain Names, underscores, full stops and any of the following characters -=[];'#,./!"Ã‚Â£$%^&*()+{}:@~<>? must not be used.

When choosing a password a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 25 characters including both alphanumeric characters and must be used without any spaces. It is advisable not to use obvious dictionary words eg password or consecutive numbers or letters or obvious personal information such as children's name, pet's names or date of birth. Password should not be the same as the username, name or email address and should not be re-used when choosing a new password.

Each registered user is responsible for the security and proper use of their user name and password and must not disclose either to any third party (whether directly, via a Website or application interface or otherwise). It is each registered user's responsibility to change their password immediately if they believe it has been compromised. It is also advisable to change these details frequently even if not considered compromised.

<br>.3 Termination or suspension. We may suspend or terminate a user's account registration if these terms and conditions are breached, in particular paragraph 2 (acceptable use).

<br>.4 Deletion of dormant customer account profiles. If your account registration profile is unused for a period of 2 years or more we may delete it from our systems without prior notice to you. If you want to access Sky.com in the future you would need to re-register your details and create a new user name and password.

<br>.5 Where you use your Sky iD on any Sky hardware or devices (for example but not limited to Sky Glass), then you agree that we may automatically update the software in your hardware by sending signals to it, for any of the reasons set out below provided that:

a) we reasonably consider that you are not materially disadvantaged by the update; and

b) energy consumption of your Sky Glass TV or compatible device shall not deteriorate without your express consent at the time of such update.

If you do not allow software updates you may not be able to access or use certain features of your hardware. We will not be liable to you for any losses or damages you incur as a result of not allowing any software updates.

We may update software in order to help improve the security and operation of our technical infrastructure (for example, to prevent misuse of our platform), for valid legal or regulatory reasons, to enable us to continue to provide you with the goods or services in accordance with what we have agreed to provide or as otherwise agreed.

11. General
11.1 Invalidity etc. If any court or regulator decides that any provision of these terms and conditions is invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provisions shall be severed and deleted from these terms and conditions and the remainder of these terms and conditions shall continue to have full force and effect.

11.2 Governing Law. These terms and conditions and the Sky Site are governed by English law. Disputes can be dealt with by the English courts.
