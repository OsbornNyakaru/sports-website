            <p class="card-text">Max Verstappen wasn’t convinced at the end of the French Grand Prix that he could have pulled off victory over Charles Leclerc had the Monegasque not crashed out (and yes, we’re getting to that).

                Once that Leclerc-shaped obstacle had been removed, though, Verstappen was able to manage his pace to cross the line 10s to the good over 2021 title rival Lewis Hamilton. It was his seventh victory of the season, and his second-straight win at Paul Ricard. He also now has a 63-point advantage in the drivers’ standings – meaning he could sit out two Grands Prix and still head the standings. That’s a pretty cushty cushion.
                Despite their oft-quoted struggles in 2022, Mercedes have been scoring podiums on a remarkably consistent basis. But the French Grand Prix was the first time both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell have made the rostrum together this year.

                Hamilton aced his 300th start to get ahead of Perez, putting himself P2 once Leclerc had crashed out, while Russell’s own heated scrap with Perez was settled in his favour when he aced the Virtual Safety Car restart and passed the Mexican. No wonder Team Principal Toto Wolff called it “the maximum” they could have achieved.</p>

Gasly exited Q1 on Saturday before finishing a disappointed (and sweaty) P12 at the flag on Sunday.

                Yuki Tsunoda aced qualifying for his first Q3 since Baku, but saw his race undone by Lap 1 contact with Esteban Ocon, the Japanese driver retiring from the race on Lap 20 given his increasing damage. That’s now four races without a point for AlphaTauri, their dreams of achieving a P5 finish in the constructors’ this year looking increasingly remote.

                Winner: Alpine
                Fernando Alonso completed the most number of laps of any F1 driver ever midway through the 2022 French Grand Prix – and that experience showed, as he baited the McLarens behind him in order to deliberately hurt their tyres, before crossing the line P6, for his second top-six finish of 2022.
                
                Ocon, meanwhile, secured his first ever points at his home race with P8, recovering from that contact with Tsunoda and the five-second penalty that went with it to secure double points for Alpine on home soil, moving the team four points clear of McLaren for P4 in the constructors’.</p>

From Charles Leclerc’s critical crash to the latest off-track political games, here’s 10 of the biggest talking points from the weekend.
                    Since Honda left Formula 1, power units that are manufactured, assembled and supported by the Japanese company have won seven out of 11 Grands Prix this season.

The engines are badged as Red Bull and the only evidence that Honda are still involved is via their HRC (Honda Racing Corporation) logo, which is tucked away at the back of the RB18’s and sister team AlphaTauri’s respective engine covers.

Honda senior management have come to terms with their decision to leave, despite the exit coinciding with huge success for their technology – but that does not mean the company are done with Formula 1 forever. Far from it. Many inside the company are believed to be keen for a return

                <p class="card-text">CARLOS SAINZ has developed into more of a “team leader” at Ferrari than teammate Charles Leclerc, according to 1996 F1 world champion Damon Hill. Leclerc, who won his third race of the season in Austria two weeks ago, crashed out of the French Grand Prix while leading on lap 18 in what he later simply admitted as a “mistake” in losing the rear of the car.

                    Sainz, meanwhile, progressed from the back of the grid and opted to stay out on track whilst fighting for a podium place with Sergio Perez, despite calls from the Ferrari pit wall for him to come into the pits, with a five-second penalty also needing to be adhered to.
                    The Spaniard overtook the Red Bull driver before later coming into the pit lane, eventually finishing fifth, but Hill told Sky Sports’ Any Driven Monday show that Sainz has not shied away from making calls himself out on track. “Carlos has struck me as actually the more of the team leader,” said Hill. “He seems to be more familiar with the strategy, seems to be able to make decisions.”
                    "He seems to be more familiar with the strategies"- Carlos Sainz 'more of a team leader' than Charles Leclerc at Ferrari, claims former F1 champion
