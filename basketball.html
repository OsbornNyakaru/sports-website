                    The Suns matched a record-breaking $133m, four-year offer sheet that Ayton agreed to on Thursday with the Indiana Pacers as soon as it was received as they did not want to risk losing their starting center and former No 1 pick for nothing.</p>

In and around the flurry of activity, we got looks — some just glimpses, some longer — at members of the rookie class of 2022 (drafted or not) who will offer the league a youthful boost going forward.

                    Here’s how those facing the loftiest expectations, the lottery picks, fared in Vegas, with a few honorable mentions for those newbies outside that select 14:
                    Ratings for the World Track & Field Championships are the highest in years. Plus: a double-digit increase in NBA Summer League viewership and more.

                    hen James Harden entered the NBA in 2009, the league’s highest-paid player, Kobe Bryant, made just over $23m a year. Now, there are 50 players making more than that sum, and the highest-paid among them, Steph Curry, will make a hair over $48m in 2022-23.

                    But when Harden declined his player-option of $47.3m next season to sign a new two-year contract (with a player-option in Year 2) worth $68.6m that will see him take a $14m discount next year, he became the first star player.

                    After being traded from the Atlanta Falcons to the Indianapolis Colts, Matt Ryan is back in the spotlight. He joins a talented Colts team that many expect to win their division and make some noise in the playoffs. A big reason why many feel this way is that Matt Ryan is now the team’s quarterback.

The narcologist, Mikhail Tetyushkin, explained that "medical cannabis is a popular treatment specifically among athletes" in many countries outside Russia.
