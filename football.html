                    The NFL as a whole had a fairly interesting off-season, but nothing compared to the action that took place in the AFC West. We will look at the moves made by each team and a prediction on whether these moves will help them be successful for the 2022 season or if the big moves were all for naught. But the ultimate question remains: Could a contender for Super Bowl LVII emerge from this conference?</p>

            <p class="card-text">After playing the opening four games of the German Football League season without a win, and watching as their playoff hopes were rapidly vanishing, the Berlin Rebels turned themselves into contenders again this past weekend after winning their second straight game, edging the Berlin Adler 49-44 on a last second touchdown.
                Trailing 44-41 with eight seconds left on the clock and with the ball on the Adler four-yard line, Rebels quarterback Donovan Isom took the shotgun snap, stepped back, lobbed the ball into the deep lefthand corner of the end zone and watched as wide receiver Nigel Westbrooks made a leaping grab just dragging his heels for the game-winning touchdown before falling out of bounds.</p>

                <p class="card-text">et, the fact the Wolverines had the lead would be a shock to many who watched the game. The Roosters looked 1000% better and their defense was the main reason. The Roosters‘ front seven reached Harris in the backfield six times in the first half. Spectators were actually beginning to feel sorry for the offensive line of the Wolverines. The Roosters‘ shortcomings however came on the offensive side which according to head coach Juha Hakala, left a few scores on the field.

                    In the third quarter, however, the Roosters finally reached the end zone. Despite a poor opening drive by the offense, their second possession didn’t disappoint. They took the ball 65 yards, capping it off with a three-yard quarterback sneak by Bryce Stancombe.
                    
                    From then on out, the Roosters were in complete control. The defense flat-out dominated a Wolverines offense that could not seem to get anything right suddenly. A Wolverines‘ screen pass was transformed into a safety by a ferocious Roosters defense. In fact, the Wolverines only had possession of the ball for a total of one minute and 42 seconds in the entire fourth quarter. The game simply couldn’t end fast enough for the beleaguered Wolverines offensive line.
